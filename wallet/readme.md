# Wallet API Endpoints

This document provides details on the wallet-related API endpoints, which are used for creating wallets, checking balances, and initiating payments for funding.

### Automatic Wallet Creation

It's important to note that a wallet is automatically created for an organization as soon as it is registered, thanks to a `post_save` signal on the `Organization` model. The manual creation endpoint below is available but typically not needed for new organizations.

### 1. Create Wallet (Manual)

-   **URL:** `/wallet/create/`
-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Description:** Manually triggers the creation of a wallet for a specified organization. This is useful if the automatic creation failed or for other specific scenarios.
-   **Authentication:** `Bearer <access_token>` required.
-   **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
        "organization_id": "your_organization_uuid"
    }
    ```
-   **Response Body (201 CREATED):**
    ```json

        "message": "Wallet created successfully",
